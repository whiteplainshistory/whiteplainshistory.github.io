  The Purdy House was built by Samuel Horton, an early
  settler, who remained in possession until after 1730,
  when Samuel Purdy purchased the house and 132 acres.
  <p>
  Title see-sawed from Samuel to his son, Jacob, then
  back to Samuel, and finally to Jacob about 1785.
  One explanation might be because two of Samuel's
  five sons became Loyalists and fled to Canada.
  Jacob held title until his own death in 1822.
  <p>
  The Purdy family continued in possession until the
  house was sold to Samuel Mott in 1869.
  <p>
  By the 1960's the house, forgotten and neglected,
  had become a multi-family dwelling, slated for
  demolition by the Urban Renewal Agency.
  <p>
  The Battle of White Plains Monument Committee
  purchased the house in 1963, and repaired and restored
  old beams and shingles.  In 1973, when the house moved 
  to its present site on Park Avenue, the house was
  deeded to the City of White Plains.
  <p>
  The Jacob Purdy House has been source-documented as
  General Washington's Headquarters from July 23 to
  September 16, 1778.  Historians also believe it to have
  been the General's Headquarters before the Chatterton 
  Hill battle of October 28, 1776.
  <p>
  On April 31, 1979, the house was placed upon the 
  National Register of Historic Places.
