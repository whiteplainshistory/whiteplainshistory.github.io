	<a href="/exhibits/hoch/Battle-of-White-Plains-Roster.pdf" target=_shadow>list</a><font color="darkblue"><sup>*</sup></font>
	has been compiled from various primary and secondary sources in order to better identify those individuals 
	(American, British and German)  who participated in the Battle of White Plains, the regiments in which they served, and 
	as many details as possible as to where they were positioned and what happened to them during those days.  
	This is a partial list that will be updated on a regular basis.  The public is welcome to make additions and corrections.  
	All inquiries about this project can be sent to the White Plains Historical Society, 60 Park Avenue, White Plains, NY 10603,
