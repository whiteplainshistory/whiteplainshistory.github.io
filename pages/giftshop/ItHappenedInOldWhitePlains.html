<h4>Birthplace of New York State</h4>
<p>
<b>The Declaration of Independence,</b> America's 
most famous document, is forever linked in history 
to White Plains.  The Declaration, our nation's birth
certificate, set the stage for the birth of New York
State here.
<p>
It all began in 1776 when George III's warships,
filled with soldiers, sailed into New York harbor.
The Third Provincial Congress, meeting in the city,
hurriedly left, and on the morning of July 9th
reconvened in the modest wooden courthouse on
the Village Street in White Plains.
<p>
General Nathaniel Woodhull, destined to lose his
life a few weeks later in the battle on Long Island,
was elected president of the body.  Westchester was
represented by 12 deputies, all of whom were present
that day: Colonel Pierre Van Cortlandt, Colonel
Louis Graham, Major Ebenezer Lockwood, Captain
Jonathan Platt, Colonel Gilbert Drake, General
Lewis Morris, Governeur Morris, William Paulding,
Zebediah Mills, Jonathan G. Tompkins, Samuel
Crawford and Samuel Haviland.  John Jay representing
New York City, was also in attendance.
<p>
In the morning a courier, having ridden from
Philadelphia, finally caught up with the congress
and delivered a document from the Continental
Congress that declared the 13 colonies free and
independent from Britain.  This document was handed
to a five-man committee chaired by Jay for
recommendation.  That afternoon, despite the presence of
the enemy in New York City and their personal 
danger, the group returned the recommendation 
that the independence document be approved.
<p>
The resulting resolution penned that day bore a
new designation for the body.  <i>"Convention of the
Representatives of the State of New York"</i> it 
commenced, then continued: <i>"White Plains, July 9th,
1776: Resolved unanimously that the reasons
assigned by the Continental Congress for declaring
the United Colonies free and independent STATES
are cogent and conclusive and that while we lament
the cruel necessity which had rendered that
measure unavoidable, we approve same and will
at the RISQUE of our Lives and Fortunes join with
the other colonies in defending it."</i>
<p>
After this resolution had been carefully transcribed
by the clerk, could some lingering doubt
concerning the course they had chosen have been
the reason for a slight change then ordered in the
resolution?  The word "defending" was neatly
scratched out, and inserted above was the word
"supporting."  Certainly the men who signed that
resolution in White Plains were fully aware that the
substitution of one word for another could not
mitigate what, in the eyes of the British, was a
heinous crime, punishable by death.
<p>
Five hundred
<a href="/pages/giftshop/1776Handbill.html" target="_blank">handbills</a>
were ordered printed and
handed out on July 11th, when Judge John Thomas
of Purchase read the Declaration of Independence
"to the beat of drums" from the courthouse steps.
It was the first time these stirring words had been
heard in public in New York, and it happened in
White Plains.  The change of name for the Congress,
"state" being substituted for "provincial" in the
resolution, coupled with the reading of the 
Declaration made White Plains the state's birthplace.
<p>
From July 9th to July 27th, when Congress adjourned,
White Plains remained the seat of the revolutionary
government.  Furthermore, work on the 
first constitution for the State of New York was
begun here.  The finalized constitution was adopted
by the convention at Kingston on the Hudson on
April 20th, 1777.

only three known to remain in existence.
