<p>
One of the most colorful characters to come to White Plains
was William Muldoon.
<p>
Standing five feet ten, 180 pounds, Muldoon became
America's wrestling champion in 1879. He invented the medicine
ball, believed in proper diet and exercise, and hot water drinks.
<p>
In 1886, Muldoon wrestled with and beat the famous John L. Sullivan,
the champion prize fighter. Three years later he trained Sullivan
for his fight with Jake Kilrain. In spite of
Sullivan's high living, with Muldoon as his ringside second, Sullivan won
in Round 75.
<p>
Muldoon also trained Sullivan for the James Corbett fight, but his fighter
failed to heed his instructions. Sulllivan was felled by Corbett, who was thirty
pounds lighter, and Muldoon refused to train Sullivan again.
<p>
About 1890, Muldoon purchased the Carhart mansion and established his
Hygienic Institute in the building. He rehabilitated men who had "made fools of
themselves for so long they had forgotten the art of living," and those who were
overworked mentally, needed a rest, or wanted to reduce.
<p>
In 1894, the famous woman journalist, Nellie Bly, having taken the White Plains
Keeley Institute cure, angled herself into Muldoon's Institute. Nellie,
reporting her experiences there, mentioned that the mansion, with its opulent
interiors, had cost $100,000 to construct.
<p>
In May 1897, Robert Fitzsimmons was a guest, and three weeks later,
ex-champ Sullivan arrived for a special course. He lasted less than two weeks.
When Muldoon caught him drinking, Sullivan was expelled from the institution.
<p>
When Muldoon first came to White Plains, the townspeople were not happy.
They considered him a "sport" who worked with fighters and surrounded himself
with "gangs of toughs." It was not long, however, before they were welcoming
the celebrity living amongst them, and looked forward to the frequent times
he was seen striding the streets of the village, clad in a white overcoat, and trailed
by a Saint Bernard dog, "as big as a Shetland pony."
<p>
He continued an interest in the village even after he relocated to Purchase 
about 1900. On November 22, 1908, he participated in the celebration of the
225th anniversary of the purchase of White Plains, and personally led the first
division in the parade.
<p>
In 1924, Muldoon was appointed Chairman of the New York State Athletic 
Commission during the governorship of Alfred E. Smith.
