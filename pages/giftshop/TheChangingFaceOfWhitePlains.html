The fourth county courthouse to be built in White Plains was completed in
1916 on Main Street on a block bordered by Court Street, Martine Avenue and
Grand Street.  Built of cast granite manufactured in Tuckahoe, Westchester's
marble industry center, the complete cost of the building amounted to
$449,062.15.  Fifteen cents?  In 1977 the Doric columns that lined the front of
the building came tumbling down to make way for the huge Galleria mall,
already under construction.
