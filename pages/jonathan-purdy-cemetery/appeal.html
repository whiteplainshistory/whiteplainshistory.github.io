The White Plains Historical Society is committed to seeking financial grants to help restore the
Jonathan Purdy family cemetery, but we need additional financial support from people like you in
order to make any serious progress on the repair and maintenance of the site.   Your donation to
this cause is tax deductible and will be matched with additional funding committed by the White
Plains Historical Society.  Together with your help, we will preserve the colonial and early
national heritage of White Plains and assure the existence of the Jonathan Purdy Family
Cemetery well into the future.
<p>
Please help us by donating online.
