<p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial">Treasuring Past Shapes An Historian's Future</font></b></font>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="2">
</font><p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">An historical tour of Shrub Oak is exciting if your guide
is White Plains historian Renoda Hoffman. Her descendants settled the area,
building homes on Main Street, Stoney Street, Glen Road and James Street.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman's main ancestors, descended from the Ferris family
of Shrub Oak, started with Jeffrey Ferris who came over from England in 1632.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">John James, Hoffman's great-great grandfather, lived on
the corner of Main and Stoney streets.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman is not a shrinking violet. Deep down, she's tough
and persevering, in spite of an aura of old world gentility.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"I always wanted to be related to Jesse James,"
she said, not disappointed that John James was thought to be illegitimate.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Her grandmother and grandfather, Elizabeth Ferris and
Gustave Brown, lived on Stoney Street and Glen Road, where they raised 13
children, including her father, Alonzo.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">She noted her grandmother routinely fed the area's
legendary "Leather Man," a character dressed head to toe in leather
who lived in caves around what is now the Taconic State Parkway area.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Her grandfather, Gus Brown, was an itinerant worker who
traveled around fixing watches. He'd even deliver the Sunday paper to the
wealthy summer people who lived around Lake Mahopac.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In 1893, they presented a gift to Gus Brown - tickets,
hotel reservation and enough money to visit the Columbian World's Fair in
Chicago, an event he dreamed of attending, but never thought he could.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Her aunt Lena (Helena Brown) was born in a house on New
Street. She married the superintendent of one of the iron factories in
Peekskill, Harry S. Gwynne, related to the Vanderbilts.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Owning a car was one thing when cars first came out,
driving it was something else. Rules and regulations for moving vehicles,
including a driver's license, were as yet unheard of circa 1910.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman's uncle, Charlie James, forgot how to stop his
brand new car, driving it into the garage and out the rear wall. Both James and
Hoffman's father treasured this anecdote and repeated it often.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Despite his brother-in-law's hapless automobile incident
as a young man, Hoffman's father, Alonzo, went into the hacking or taxi business
in Peekskill.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">He also took a week's job with Ajax, a strong man who was
performing at the Peekskill Theatre, putting a board across his chest, then
inviting six or seven people to stand on it.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">However, the main trick in the act was to keep a car from
taking off. The strong man held ropes attached to the car like reins. To keep
from being dragged off the stage, he was also tied with rope attached to a hook
firmly anchored in the stage floor.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"Dad would start the car, the momentum lifted the
rear wheels off the floor, spinning, wildly, but the strong man was able to hold
the car," Hoffman related, having heard the story from her father, although
the event took place long before she was born.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"One day, my dad, hurrying to the theatre, had a flat
tire. Not having time to change the tire and still get to the theatre on time,
he kept on going. He drove onto the stage, but the trick was doomed. The rear
wheels would not raise from the floor, and the car not only wanted to go
forward, it did. The car and Ajax went flying off the stage."</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Born in Peekskill at their house on James Street, Renoda
Brown was only 9 months old when her father moved the family to White Plains in
1920, although she returned to Peekskill and Shrub Oak every summer of her
youth, visiting her large family.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">A quiet man, but a lot of fun, Alonzo now had a steady mob
working for a clothier. Who would have dreamed that his daughter would become
the historian for the City of White Plains in 1970?</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Channel 34 in White Plains has begun a series of Renoda
Hoffman's historic photographs and commentary.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"I like the idea of doing a television series on the
changing face of White Plains," she said. "I have hundreds of
photographs that people can enjoy while learning about White Plains as it used
to be."</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"Round and About Broadway" was her first
televised show, shown every Monday in December. Next, with the date to be
announced, is "And Tehen Came the Galleria," recreating the City of
White Plains before it underwent a massive facelift. The Galleria opened in
August, 1980, part of the urban renewal project that cost $100 million.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Encouraged by the success of her previous books, It
Happened in White Plains, and Yesterday in White Plains, she'd even consider And
Then Came the Galleria as the basis for a third book.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"I'm looking for an angel who has $25,000 to help
publish it," Hoffman commented.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">The author/historian came upon her new-found career in her
later years.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"I was just a housewife until 1960, happy and content
with my family, never volunteering for things," she said.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">However, she did take a part-time job in 1947 to help out
her neighbor who was principal of Purchase Elementary School. Working as a
school secretary for a few hours a week for many years turned out to be her life
saver.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Married almost 23 years to Howard C. Hoffman, known as
"Pete," an engineer with the City of White Plains, she recalled,
"Pete was the talker - more socially adept. Through him, we knew a lot of
people," she said.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">When he taught radio at night school (now kown as adult
education), she took dressmaking.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"We were very close; I was very shy and retiring. If
I heard someone lecture to a group, my immediate thought was, 'I couldn't do
that'."</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Aware that her husband was desperately ill in 1960,
Hoffman revamped a viable future for maintaining their home and educating their
son. To that end, she became a full-time school secretary at Purchase School, a
job she held for 30 years, retiring in 1977.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">When Pete died in 1960, Hoffman was crushed by his death,
soldiering on seemed to be the only way to assuage her grief. It was this job
that led to her commitment to the history of White Plains.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In 1961, Mary Andrews, a local photographer, presented a
slide lecture at the school. Hoffman assisted by fitting slides into the
projector, making sure each one was the right one for Andrews' commentary.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">After working with Andrews on several slide programs,
Hoffman sensed a reawakening of her fascination for history. Subsequently,
Andrews invited her to join the Westchester County Historical Society. Before
long, Hoffman was invited to be a trustee.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"I didn't know if I could do it!" she
remembered, noting that Andrews told her to "Take it!"</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">The Westchester County Historical Society was run by
volunteers in the '60s, albeit professionals such as doctors, lawyers, teachers
and college professors. Hoffman, who had never attended college, was an
exception.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">However, they took her under their wing, teaching her the
rudiments of running the county historical society and much about local history.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">She remembers being terrified at giving her first report,
but mustered up the courage at a full board meeting, thanks to the encouragement
of her fellow volunteers.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In 1977, she became the society's first woman president in
its 103rd year of existence, a post she held for three years, until 1980. She
was asked, in 1964, to edit the society's quarterly publication, a popular
booklet entitled, "The Historian," ordered by history buffs throughout
the U.S.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">That meant "do the whole darn thing," Hoffman
recalled.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">However, retired Army Colonel Louis Frohman, a local
photographer and member of Westchester County Historical Society (WCHS), offered
his help. Together, they put out two editions before he laid the project in her
hands for the next 20 years.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In 1984, Hoffman ended her tenure as editor of "The
Historian," turning it over to younger volunteers because she was writing
books, co-founding the White Plains Historical Society and restoring the
interior of Washington's Headquarters, known as the Purdy House, at 60 Park
Avenue, White Plains, mostly at her own expense.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">As editor of "The Historian," Hoffman became
known to historians all over the United States for the integrity of the writing
and the little known but relevant history she unearthed, according to fellow
historians throughout Westchester County.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">During her stint as editor, Hoffman was appointed
historian of White Plains. Her salary for the task, to which she was appointed
in 1970 by then-Mayor Richard Hendey, was zero.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">She remembered Hendey as being less than supportive,
telling her upon announcement of her appointment in 1970, "Now you run
along and do whatever historians do." That included paying for everything
herself, except stationery. Today she has a budget that cannot exceed $1,500.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">A city administrator telephoned her just as 1990 was
coming to an end.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"Renoda, you know they cut back on your budget!"
he said.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">He was floored by the ire of this gentle lady who has
learned how to defend the world of local history.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">According to Renoda, he was taken aback, and replied,
"Hold it, take it easy! Renoda, we'll work on your budget!"</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">What does a historian do?</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"History is our business," said Hoffman.
"It's done in different ways. There are no rules for us."</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">A historian does anything that would be connected to a
city's history with a date on it, even a little memento, like an old-fashioned
dance invitation.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman is a great record keeper, using acid-free paper to
mount newspaper articles, including obituaries in voluminous scrapbooks. Old
newspapers like The Daily Argus, The Daily Reporter and The Daily Record supply
priceless memorabilia for her scrapbooks, merging with current events in White
Plains.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Together, she said, they form a complete history that is
supplemented by hundreds, maybe thousands, of slides she has taken of every
block of the city.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">A card table in her living room has scissors, paste,
newspapers neatly stacked and a scrapbook ready to be filled. The wonder is that
she's up to date and ready to clip and paste tomorrow's news about people and
events in White Plains.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">About five years ago, she got permission to store her
records in a small space in the White Plains Library, including her assessment
books for the village of White Plains dating back to the 1870s. They list
everybody's name, address and what they paid in taxes.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">She also rescued a lot of things from the village court,
old summonses, judges' summations or verdicts, and what the guilty had to pay.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In addition, she found a huge file in the old civilian
defense building that contained legal papers from the 1860s to the 1900s, past
records from the city that were never catalogued, but are now safe.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman has archives at White Plains Library and is trying
to get an archivist to work on school records that go back to the last century.
They contain dates, names, and addresses that are supplemented by high school
yearbooks from 1898 to the 1930s.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman has been able to write two books, hold the office
of president of the Westchester County Historical Society and edit its
publication "The Historian," and co-found the White Plains Historical
Society while holding the office of White Plains historian.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Proceeds from the sale of Yesterday in White Plains and It
Happened in White Plains are donated to the historic Jacob Purdy House, owned by
the City of White Plains.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">As vice-president of the White Plains Historical Society
since 1984, Hoffman immediately put the complete restoration of the Purdy House
on her agenda, regardless of the expense.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Last year, General Washington's headquarters (1776 and
1778) at 60 Park Avenue, known as the Purdy House, was finally restored at a
cost of more than $100,000, with $47,000 toward the restoration of the interior
from the sale of Hoffman's first book, Yesterday in White Plains, and an
additional $25,000 from IBM. The City of White Plains paid for the exterior
restoration.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman's books are sold at White Plains Public Library,
but word-of-mouth creates an astounding number of sales. Book stores take 40% of
all sales, while Hoffman's method assures that 100% of the proceeds from her
book sales will go toward the restoration of Purdy House.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Hoffman, it seems, cannot be filed and categorized like
historical minutia - she's always looking toward tomorrow to learn something
about yesterday.</font></font></p>
