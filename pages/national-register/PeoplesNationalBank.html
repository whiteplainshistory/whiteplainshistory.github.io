In 1795, the first Methodist Church in
White Plains was completed on the NW
corner of Broadway and Cemetery Road.  It
was destroyed by fire on the same day it was
dedicated, and rebuilt in 1797.  Today the
building serves as the Rural Cemetery Office.
<p>
The Reverend Sylvester Hutchinson, who died on September 19, 1797, was the first
person to be interred in the burying ground.
<p>
The Rural Cemetery Association was formed in 1854.  Though records for the early
years are not complete, approximately 24,000 burials have been made in the cemetery
above.
