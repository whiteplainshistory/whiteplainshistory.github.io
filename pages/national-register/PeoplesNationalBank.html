The Peoples National Bank &amp; Trust Company was
organized in the summer of 1924.  It opened on
September 2nd in the Depot Plaza on the corner of
Martine Avenue with a capital of $100,000.  In
November of 1929, the bank moved into the new
nine-story building on the corner of Martine and
Mamaroneck Avenues.  
Prior to the bank's erection, the
YMCA, which had occupied the site for a number
of years, sold it to the bank and built its present
building on Mamaroneck Avenue, near Maple Avenue.
<p>
In 1983, while redecorating the bank's interior,
removal of a wall uncovered a 30 by 40 foot mural,
an allegorical depiction of the settlement of White
Plains.  Subsequent research found that the mural's
color plan was created by Angelo Magnanti.  Alex
Bonanno did the actual painting.
