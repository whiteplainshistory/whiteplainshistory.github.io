Percy Grainger purchased the former David Cromwell
home at 7 Cromwell Place (c.1893) and with his
mother moved into the house on March 4th, 1921.
The following year Mrs. Grainger died.
<p>
Four years later, while returning to the States
following a concert tour in Australia, Grainger met 
Ella Strom, the Swedish poet and artist. The
shipboard romance blossomed and two years later,
on August 9th, 1928, during an intermission in his
Hollywood Bowl concert in California, they were
married before an audience of 20,000 people. That 
evening he played for the first time, as a gift to his
bride, his composition "To a Nordic Princess."
<p>
Grainger brought his bride back to his Cromwell
Place home. Following his death on February 20th,
1961 at the age of 78, his widow remained in the
house. She was 90 when she died here in July 1979.
<p>
On invitation, the composer performed three times at
the White House, for Woodrow Wilson, Calvin
Coolidge, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
<p>
His composition "Country Gardens", played by
Grainger at all his appearances during the war bond
drives, has come to be the best remembered of all
his works.
