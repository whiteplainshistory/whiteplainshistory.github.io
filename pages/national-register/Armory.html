The cornerstone of the armory was laid on March
31st, 1909.  The main speaker of the day was Senator
J. Mayhew Wainwright.  A member of the family,
General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, would later
gain fame as a hero of Corregidor during World War
II. The president of the Village Board of Trustees,
Frederick S. Barnum, introduced the senator.

That year, the armory greeted its first occupant,
Company L 10th Regiment of the National Guard,
newly organized with a membership of seventy-six.
During World War I this company served in France
for 18 months.  Many of the men were wounded or
lost their lives, including their captain, Frederick W.
Cobb.  The New York National Guard was federalized
in the 1920s.  In 1927 the 102nd Medical
Regiment moved into the armory and later served
in the Pacific during World War II.

The yellow brick castle-like armory lifts its
crenelated tower one hundred and ten feet into the
sky.  The smaller matching towers flank the broad
arched entrance.  The windows are high and narrow.
Buttresses supported the 130-foot-long drill shed
where galleries looked down upon the drill floor.

<p>
The monument in front of the building, topped
with a spread-winged eagle, was erected by the
White Plains Chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution in 1910 to commemorate this
historic site where the Declaration of Independence
was read for the first time in New York State.  The
monument's base was built with stones taken from 
the foundation of the first courthouse.
