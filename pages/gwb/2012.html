    <p>
    A large crowd gathered outside the Jacob Purdy House on a beautiful, sunny afternoon to celebrate George Washington's 280th Birthday at his onetime headquarters in White Plains during the Revolutionary War.
    <p>
    The day's program included the arrival of troops, raising of the flag by Revolutionary War period re-enactors, pledge of allegiance led by 3 students from White Plains Public Schools, a prayer by First Vice President of the Society John Vorperian, and a tribute to George Washington given by President of the Society Rob Hoch. President Hoch acknowledged local politicians Mayor Tom Roach and members of the Common Council Ben Boykin, John Martin, Milagros Lecuona, and Dennis Krolian. Also in attendance was New York State Assemblyman Robert Castelli. President Hoch thanked Historical Society Trustees and Members, White Plains Citizens and everyone else for attending. He spoke about the current Purdy House Roof Restoration Project to which the City of White Plains contributed $35,000 in addition to the $5000 raised by the Society.
    <p>
    Mayor Tom Roach praised the Historical Society for its work in preserving the Purdy House and for keeping history alive in the historic City of White Plains for all to enjoy both now and in the future.
    <p>
    All were invited inside for birthday cake, cookies, mulled cider and other refreshments served by gracious volunteers.
    <p>
    Admission was free.
