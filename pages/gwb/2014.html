  <p>
   A surprisingly large crowd gathered outside the Jacob Purdy House on a beautiful, sunny somewhat warmer afternoon to celebrate George Washington's 282<sup>nd</sup> Birthday at his onetime headquarters in White Plains during the Revolutionary War.
  <p>
  The short outside program included an honor guard led by Trustee Denis Jones, raising of the flag by Revolutionary War period re-enactors and the pledge of allegiance. Our National Anthem was led by Milagros Lecuona. A prayer was led by First Vice President of the Historical Society John Vorperian. President of the Historical Society Rob Hoch presided.
  <p>
  President Hoch acknowledged local politicians Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assemblyman David Buchwald, Westchester County Legislator Ben Boykin, Mayor Tom Roach and members of the Common Council Nadine Hunt-Robinson, Milagros Lecuona, and Beth Smayda. President Hoch thanked Historical Society Trustees and Members, White Plains Citizens and everyone else for attending.
  <p>
  Mayor Roach spoke briefly on the importance of the history that played out in our fair city and thanked the Historical Society for its efforts to preserve our heritage.
  <p>
  All were invited to enjoy birthday cake, coffee, and mulled cider.
  <p>
  Our speaker was Barnet Schecter, who spoke to a full house. His topic was: "George Washington's New York: The Battles of 1776 with Maps from his Personal Collection."
  <p>
  Admission was free.
