  <small><b>February 15, 2009 - White Plains, NY.</b></small>
  
  	<p>
	It was a beautiful, sunny winter's day for those of us gathered at
	George Washington’s 277th Birthday Celebration at the Jacob Purdy House, 
	his onetime headquarters in White Plains during the Revolutionary War.
	<p>
	The day’s program included the raising of the flag, 
	pledge of allegiance led by Trustee David Buchwald, 
	and musket fire salute by Revolutionary War re-enactors.
	President Rob Hoch acknowledged local politicians, 
	and thanked Historical Society Trustees and Members, 
	White Plains Citizens and everyone else for attending.
	He read from Washington's 1790 letter to the Hebrew Congregation at Newport on the rights of all citizens.
	The Society’s Vice President John Vorperian read a few of George Washington's 
	<i>Rules of Civility & Decent Behaviour</i>.
	<p>
	All were invited inside for birthday cake, cookies, mulled cider and other refreshments.  
	A standing room only crowed enjoyed a video presentation by John Savage
	entitled <i>Rochambeau--the Other Founding Father</i>.  
	Kids ranging in age from 4 to 94 socialized upon the same floorboards once traversed by our honored birthday boy.  
	A grand time was had by all. 
	<p>
	Admission was free.
