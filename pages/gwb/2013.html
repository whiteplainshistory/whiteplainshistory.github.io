  <p>
  A small crowd briefly gathered outside the Jacob Purdy House on a beautiful, sunny but cold and windy afternoon to celebrate George Washington's 281st Birthday at his onetime headquarters in White Plains during the Revolutionary War.
  <p>
  The short outside program included the arrival of troops, raising of the flag by Revolutionary War period re-enactors, and the pledge of allegiance. Inside, a prayer was led by First Vice President of the Historical Society John Vorperian, and a tribute to George Washington given by President of the Historical Society Rob Hoch. President Hoch acknowledged local politicians Mayor Tom Roach and members of the Common Council Ben Boykin, and Beth Smayda and Westchester County Legislator Bill Ryan. Also in attendance was New York State Assemblyman David Buchwald. President Hoch thanked Historical Society Trustees and Members, White Plains Citizens and everyone else for attending.
  <p>
  All were invited to enjoy birthday cake, cookies, mulled cider and other refreshments.
  <p>
  Admission was free.
