  <p>
  The 21st Annual Dinner Event was held on May 6th at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains. President Rob Hoch presided.
  <p>
  An honor guard of Revolutionary War re-enactors led by Trustee Denis Jones presented Old Glory. Trustee Bruce Handler led the Pledge of Allegiance. Councilwoman Milagros Lecuona, a bit surprised to be asked, beautifully led the singing of our national anthem. First Vice President John Vorperian gave us our blessing.
  <p>
  Chairwoman Patti Indelicato proclaimed the Nominating Committee's report. Presented for three year terms on the Board of Trustees were David Buchwald, Denis Jones, Dan Haines, and Miriam Varian. Presented for one year terms as officers were President Rob Hoch, First Vice President John Vorperian, Second Vice President Lou DeGenaro, and Treasurer Ray Indelicato. All were elected without opposition.
  <p>
  In attendance were Westchester County Legislator Bill Ryan, Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, Mayor Adam Bradley, and Common Council Members Tom Roach, Ben Boykin, Milagros Lecuona, Dennis Power, Beth Smyrna and David Buchwald, Society Members and guests.
  <p>
  A special tribute was given to the late Walter Handelman and to his sister Alice Model for their generosity in support of the White Plains Historical Society, Renoda Hoffman and the publication of Yesterday in White Plains.
  <p>
  The
  <a href="/pages/CitizenExtraordinaire.html" target=_ce>Citizen Extraordinaire Award</a>  
  was conferred upon Riena Kaplow. Her family and friends were present to witness this proud moment. Trustee and Former President Robert Friedman made the introduction and presentation. This day has been designated as "Riena Kaplow Day" in the City of White Plains as declared by White Plains Common Council President Tom Roach, and in the County of Westchester as declared by Legislator Bill Ryan.
  <p>
  The guest speaker was Arthur S. Lefkowitz, a noted writer and historian who presented an entertaining slide show comprising art works of the Revolutionary War, including many portraits of George Washington. We learned that full length portraits "cost an arm and a leg" and that the famous painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze has many historical inaccuracies. The historically accurate flag would have been the Grand Union Flag, and the river depicted is the Rhine of Germany where the artist lived and painted in 1850. The painting on exhibit at Metropolitan Museum of Art is a second painting originally purchased by Marshall O. Roberts, changed ownership several times, and was donated by John Stewart Kennedy in 1897.
