  A sunny, very windy day at the Jacob Purdy House greeted a large crowd for the 
  230th Battle White Plains Celebration. Presented were: stirring music by the
  White Plains High School Band, flag-raising ceremony, reading of the roll of
  honor (names of local militiamen who actually fought in the Battle of White Plains),
  recreation of a Revolutionary War campsite and a video presentation of the battle.
  There were activities for children and free refreshments including mulled cider,
  cookies, cake and apples. Admission was free. 
  <p>
  The Battle of White Plains was fought October 28, 1776. It is an often overlooked
  battle in history because of the small number of troops involved. However, it is
  really a very important battle in the New York campaign of 1776. The American army
  lost a series of major battles from Long Island through Manhattan. When
  General Washington fortified the hills of White Plains and made a stand, it
  stopped the northward advance of the British army.
